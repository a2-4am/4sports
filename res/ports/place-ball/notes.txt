original uses 6 external files for puzzle data
named PUZZLE01 .. PUZZLE06

$5100 JSR $1015

$1015 JMP $1127

$1127 JSR $11BC

$11BC gets number of next puzzle to load
and converts it to ASCII and modifies the filename in situ
(starts at $12B4, only digit that changes is at $12BC
although code can handle more than 9 if necessary)

$112A uses ProDOS MLI to open the now-properly-named file
then execution continues at $1138 if no error on open

$1138 sets length ($200) and address ($6A00)
then continues to $11E2

$11E2 reads and closes the file

game code includes first (tutorial) level, so the first
disk access isn't until after you solve that, to load PUZZLE01
