exomizer mem -q -P23 -lnone -f "OBJ"@0x0900 -o "OBJ.X"

-f means forward decrunching so it'll start at $900 and
work its way up

use version of exodecrunch that's in Passport with
DECRUNCH_FORWARDS = 1

that version also supports drawing a progress bar

it's OK if earlier compressed data gets overwritten by
uncompressed data (decrunch never needs to go back to
previous data) so just load compressed data high enough
in memory that it can read and write the final bytes
i.e. uncompressed data ends at $AFFF so compressed data
can start before that as long as it ends after $B000

warning: XSingle index pads reads to 512 bytes
so don't put compressed data TOO high or the padding
might end up clobbering ProDOS code at $BF00
